#ðŸŒ² terra0 ðŸŒ²
terra0 is a project building a modular, open-source framework for automated ecosystem and natural resources management, community farming initiatives, and natural asset - NFT binding.   

This repository contains the smart contract and python repos for our most recent projects, Flowertokens and Premna Daemon, as well and archive of our initial code prototypes.


## Flowertokens
*Flowertokens* was an experimental project centered around the tokenization and verification of natural commodities, and a first attempt at creating a combined crypto-collectible physical asset.

The project is now in archive mode.

## Premna Daemon
*Premna Daemon* is an installation for the Proof of Work exhibition at Berlinâ€™s Schinkel Pavillon. The installation consists of an augmented Premna Microphylla plant, a web interface, and an Ethereum smart contract. The software and hardware system(s) the tree is embedded within - a set of technological prostheses the plant is augmented with - allow for the creation of a financially-mediated social contract to come into being between the operators of the the Proof of Work exhibition and this hybrid entity. The operators have committed to care for the various needs of the Premna Daemon (watering, lighting, leaf trimming, etc) only when Premna itself requests assistance by sending Ethereum to a wallet owned by the gallery. The Eth used for these requests is donated to Premna by users via the web interface.

The installation will run until December 21st, 2018.
